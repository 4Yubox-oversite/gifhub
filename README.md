gifhub
======

A hub for all the gifs, searchable by keyword. I know...

## Origins

Ethan (@beep) Marcotte's [bukk.it](http://bukk.it) is great, but it's hard to search and sometimes [a bit slow](http://storify.com/olivierlacan/gifhub-inception). 
And I've always wanted a good tool to search high quality GIFs out there.

## Features

* Search for GIFs by emotion, or any keyword
* Display animated thumbnails
* Provide a filtered search
* Display link to original source (bukk.it, etc)
* Cache GIFs on S3/CloudFront for speedy display

## Societal Benefits

* Help people spend less time searching for or making animated GIFs.
* Give people with poor emotional skills the ability to express themselves exclusively with pop culture references.
